export const ABOUT_STORY: string[] = [
  'Experienced full-stack web developer with a background across web and mobile development and professional experience in Dubai. Specializes in building reliable, high-performance websites, e-commerce platforms and digital experiences for UAE businesses. Rebuilt a 32-route corporate platform and led a zero-downtime migration to a cloud hosting platform while preserving Microsoft 365 email services. Combines development expertise with technical SEO, analytics and web infrastructure management.',
  'At AK International, I build and maintain corporate websites, product pages, and web applications using Next.js, WordPress, and React Native. I manage the Esthica e-commerce store on Shopify — theme updates, product catalog maintenance, and payment-gateway support — and handle technical, on-page, and off-page SEO — including Google Business Profile setup and optimization — with performance tracked through GA4 and Google Search Console. I also administer Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, cPanel, domains, DNS, SSL, hosting, backups, security, and disaster-recovery readiness.',
  'Before the web, I spent years as an Android and Flutter developer with published Google Play apps. That mobile background — plus an early move into AI-assisted engineering with Claude Code and MCP — shapes how I build: pragmatic, measurable, and fast.',
